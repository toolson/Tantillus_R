Hotend(-Clamp) without Push-Fit

The goal is a push-fit free hotend.

I loaded the STL file "TR_1x_hotend_clamp_v1_0.STL" into Freecad and modified it a bit.
I exchanged the hole for the push-fit for a conical hole (bigger at the top than at the bottom) and cut a M4 thread from the top.
When printing this clamp, make sure that the wall thickness of the hole is sufficient.

The previously slightly sharpened Teflon tube is now screwed into the Hotend Clamp from above.
It is not necessary to cut a thread on the hose beforehand.
The thread on the hose is created by itself when screwing it in. But a lot of power is necessary.
With a latex glove the hose can be held well.
Screw it in until the sharpened end of the Teflon hose at the other end looks slightly out.
Cut this end smooth with a Japanese knife or scalpel.
With me the "TR_1x_XY_carriage_spacer_v1_0" had to be adapted in Z-direction so that the slider could be moved without clamping.
Therefore the clamp has to be scaled in Z-direction before printing, depending on the thickness of the "TR_1x_XY_carriage_spacer_v1_0".

The Bowden hose must then be calibrated in the clamp with a drill or a 2mm reamer so that the filament can slide through without friction.
Make sure that no Teflon chips remain in the channel. They do not melt and can later block the nozzle, especially the 0.3 mm nozzle.
